                        My first touch with airplane has been unforgettable. I was young boy with head full with dreams for adventure.
                        The plane was  a small old “Antonov” 2. I had gotten on the last because I would be first who left it. The plane took off with twelve passenger, but this count would have been different when it landed.
                        I had sat next to the door, which was open and I was seeing the ground through its.
                        After about fifteen minutes I heard one voice – “First three stand up!” I stood up immediately, and checked the rope, whit which I was hooked to the plane. After that I jumped. The noise enveloped me. I had been stopped to think, until the parachute opened.
                        This was my first parachute jumping, but it wasn`t the last one.
                        The lending was unforgettable too, but this is an another story.

                       <h2> My own business endeavour entrepreneurship</h2>

                        My dream startup business would be smart things for smart home.  Little solutions for your dally tasks which make your live easier.
                        Firstly, I will start with a small questionnaire of five things, which would be annoying for people. I will give it to my friends. After that when they dive in to me their answers I’ll start to invent my prototypes.
                        Irrigation system for yours flowers when you are on holiday.
                        Adaptive lighting when you forgot to stop it.
                        Keychain with sound and light, which shows its location. And you can call it from your mobile.
                        These are only three things that can be develop with microcontrollers and sensors.  For all of them would be crated software with version for mobile devices.
                        Secondly. I will try to sell these ideas before their creating at half price without profit. If I don’t do this will change product. If I couldn’t sell my “smart” things at half cost, how I would sell them on a price with profit.
                        With the money of these first sales, I will finance further production.
                        This is in short the way through which I would go from idea to prototype and product realization. The next step would be to create a team but that's another topic
