                                My first touch with airplane has been unforgettable. I was young boy with head full with dreams for adventure. 
The plane was  a small old “Antonov” 2. I had gotten on the last because I would be first who left it. The plane took off with twelve passenger, but this count would have been different when it landed.  
I had sat next to the door, which was open and I was seeing the ground through its. 
After about fifteen minutes I heard one voice – “First three stand up!” I stood up immediately, and checked the rope, whit which I was hooked to the plane. After that I jumped. The noise enveloped me. I had been stopped to think, until the parachute opened.
This was my first parachute jumping, but it wasn`t the last one.
The lending was unforgettable too, but this is an another story.
